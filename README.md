This Web App was created to complete the third Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course.
This is a Client Feedback webapp.
The MVP is based in Python using Flask framework to create all migrations and deployed in Heroku's.

## Project Goals

The D Group Trade is an e-commerce company with their own website that also sells on ebay and amazon marketplaces. On eBay and Amazon they have the Feedback service provided from the marketplaces, however they haven't this pos-sale functionality in their own website.
So to help the company to better understand the customers I decided to create this WebApp in Python to link, in the future, to D Group's official website and ask our clients to give us feedback about the services and products that D Group sells.
 
The initial project is a MVP without complete CRUD, this is just a MVP with Create function to show to company directors how this will work and for Code Institute to complete the Milestone of Python essentials project.


## Users Experience Plan

The WebApp is designed for all D Group Customers who would like to give feedback about the company's product or services. This WebApp is consisted in a homepage and a success page. The homepage has a form with some fields to be completed and after the client submit the form, he'll be redirected to a success page to confirm that the form was submitted.

## Structure Plan

### Front-end

The WebApp consists in **Home** page, where the client can find the form with the follow fields to be completed, **Client Name**, **Rating** and **Comments**. The **success** page is a feedback return to the client to confirm that the form was sent to us.

<br>

- **Home Page** (`index.html`)

<br>

The main page of the website. There is a form, and 1 submit button. 

<br>

- **Success Page** (`success.html`)

<br>

<br>

This is a feedback page to confirm to the customer that the message has been sent and to thank them for their time.

### Wireframes

### Design Plan


- **Colors**

For the background color I used (#F1ECEC) to avoid the white disturbment with the forms. To submit was used a similar color os D Group Logo (#FF7F00).

## PROJECT BARRIERS & SOLUTIONS

- **DB-Link GitPod**

Was difficult to understand how to link the DB with gitpod. After a long time I checked that every time I needed to use set_pg before running the app. This was really complicated at first.

- **Deploy to Heroku**

In my first try the deployment had an error and failed a lot of times. However after a help from Code Institute Tutor that ask me about some item in my pipfile, I checked it with more care and I found the problem that my pipfile was starting with psql and not [[Source]]

### Test Strategy

Testing is required on all features and user stories documented in this README. All clickable links must redirect to the correct pages. 

 - HTML Code must pass through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Frodrigodadam.github.io%2Fscrum-master-quiz%2F)

 - CSS Code must pass through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Frodrigodadam.github.io%2Fscrum-master-quiz%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=pt-BR)

 - JavaScript code must pass through the [JSHint Validator](https://jshint.com/)
